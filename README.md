# Material React Native

This is currently a loose fork from the original [mrn](https://github.com/binggg/mrn) repository which is still a work in progress.

Please use the original repository until this is in a stable state.

## Installation

```
npm install mrn --save
```

[Copy the font](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#android) file to your local working directory:

`./node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/MaterialIcons.ttf` -> `./android/app/src/main/assets/fonts`.

## React Native 0.16

This library only works with React Native 0.16 due to the breaking changes with Babel and font loading it introduced.
